## v0.2.1
 * Removes the memory reporting. It proved to be pretty inacurate among various platforms.
 * Made the install process part of the application process. Adds some execution overhead, but this doesn't affect the actual results. On the other hand, it simplifies to minimum the installation.
 * Added the mean value for the results.
 * Added the standard deviation for the results.

## v0.2
 * Added an AJAX driven web UI.
 * Added more tests while improving the existing tests.
 * Created a drop-in architecture for easily writing tests.
 * Added a custom UI integration with Kohana / Codebench.

## v0.1
 * Simple benchmark test. Pretty much unusable by a 3rd party.
